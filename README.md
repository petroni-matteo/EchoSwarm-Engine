🕸️ EchoSwarm Engine v1.0
EchoSwarm is a high-performance, asynchronous multi-agent simulation framework designed to model complex social dynamics and behavioral patterns using Large Language Models (LLMs).

Unlike standard synchronous wrappers, EchoSwarm utilizes a decoupled microservices architecture to handle large-scale agent interactions without blocking the main execution thread.

🚀 Key Architectural Features
Asynchronous Core: Built with FastAPI and asyncio to manage parallel LLM inference tasks.

Parametric Agent Design: Agents are instantiated via psychometric vectors (Aggressiveness, Rationality, Bias, Ideology) rather than static prompts.

State Persistence: Automatic telemetry export to structured JSON for post-simulation data analysis and visualization.

Scalable Pipeline: Designed to be integrated with message brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka for million-agent simulations.

🏗️ Project Structure
main.py: The high-performance REST API and background worker engine.

app.py: A Streamlit-based control room for real-time simulation management.

requirements.txt: Environment dependencies.

🚦 Quick Start
1. Install Dependencies
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Launch the Engine (Backend)
Bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
3. Launch the Dashboard (Frontend)
Bash
streamlit run app.py
📊 Research Goals
This project provides a sandbox for:

Information Warfare: Studying echo chamber formation and narrative spreading.

Social Triggers: Testing the impact of global news on diverse demographic clusters.

Scalability: Analyzing the concurrency limits of LLM-based agents in distributed environments.

Developed for research purposes in Swarm Intelligence and Behavioral Modeling.
